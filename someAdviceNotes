# good advice:

# copy and paste a lot
# everything
# if you wrote it already and you need it again- COPY IT
# "What is this similar to?"

# Don't memorize

# Comment your code to explain what's going on
# Comment before each section
# Comment on any line that is a new idea or tricky section

#Use descriptive variable names- use long ones if it will help

# Test code as often as possible
# Don't write the whole thing at once and test each section3

# Test all cases
